    <P><a href="http://rotaractclubmce.epizy.com" > Rotaract club</a> MCE is the youth wing of Rotary Club, Hassan. Our club 
        believes in living the dreams. The incentive is to get the young minds 
        out of mediocrity and put their creative self into action. The objective 
        of Rotaract club is to provide an opportunity to enhance the knowledge 
        and skills that will assist in personal development.
        With the tint of difficulties blowing around the hedge of success, 
        we are brining the hope that energize us to Tussle, besiege the barrier 
        in the way of fortune and endeavor with zest to acquire. Tussle is a mock placement 
        event where the young profession seekers are made to peep through 
        recruitment process, mimicking all the rounds in the placement process 
        and inviting real HRs from renowned companies to take us through. 
        Previously, Tussle was funded by TEQIP (a World Bank funded 
        project for technical education and training to youths) and with the 
        Covid-19 outbreak misfortune hit, TEQIP got closed. We are setting up the platform for the young career seekers 
        to prosper with right choice of career path.
